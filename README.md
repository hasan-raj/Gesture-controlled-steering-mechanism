6. Detailed Explanation of the Idea - 

A prototype of how we can steer, accelerate a car using gestures. This can be of great use to people who Don’t have hands and legs, or even paralyzed people to drive a car. This is a Hardware –Software integrated project involving servo motor, motor driver, sensors and microcontroller.

We have often seen People who don’t have hands or legs, can’t drive a car. And even normal people while driving for long hours, face problem because their hands and legs start to pain.

There will be a motor connected with the steering, and the motor in turn will be controlled by gestures (slight movements) of the driver’s head, and the motor will turn the steering.
The next part is accelerating and braking, those will as well be controlled with gestures of the driver’s head.



7.  Solution provided - 

WORKING OF THE PROJECT:
The movements of the head are measured by accelerometer sensor which then sends signal to the microcontroller, this microcontroller then sends signal to the steering system microcontroller using radio frequency communication , then the servo motor of the steering system works according to the instructions of the micro controller of the steering system.

This gesture controlled driving system does not even require complex modification of the car , just simply a motor needs to be connected with the steering and a sensor integrated circuit needs to be worn on the head of the driver, so as to measure the gestures of the head.

Even in electric wheelchair which can be controlled with switches and joystick, can be replaced with this gesture controlling, in this way even paralyzed people and people not having hands can move their wheelchair of their own.
