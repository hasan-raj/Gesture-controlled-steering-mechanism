# Gesture-controlled-steering-mechanism


A prototype of how we can steer, accelerate a car using gestures. This can be of great use to people who Don’t have hands and legs, or even paralyzed people to drive a car. This is a Hardware –Software integrated project involving servo motor, motor driver, sensors and microcontroller.

There will be a motor connected with the steering, and the motor in turn will be controlled by gestures (slight movements) of the driver’s head, and the motor will turn the steering.
The next part is accelerating and braking, those will as well be controlled with gestures of the driver’s head.
